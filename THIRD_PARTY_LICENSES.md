# Third-Party Licenses

GOPOD is built on top of, and in the Bingo lane directly incorporates code from, several
upstream community projects. This file lists each one, GOPOD's actual relationship to it,
and reproduces the exact upstream license text — verbatim, copied directly from the real
license file on disk for each project, not paraphrased or reformatted beyond the Markdown
headings separating sections.

GOPOD's own original code ships under the MIT License — see the root `LICENSE` file.
Vendored third-party components below keep their own original licenses, unchanged, per
each project's own terms. Brand elements, persona names, character names, and video/audio
content are not code and are not covered by the MIT grant.

## Wire-Pod

- **Author:** Kerigan Creighton
- **Upstream:** [github.com/kercre123/wire-pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod)
- **Relationship to GOPOD:** GOPOD's runtime (`~/wire-pod/`) is a live clone of this
  project, its own separate git tree — not source vendored into this repo. GOPOD directly
  modifies Wire-Pod's own Go source in that tree (a hardening commit; see
  `tech/WIRED-POD.md`), and this repo's own documentation and config files
  (`customIntents.json`, prompt files) describe and extend that installation. Included here
  for transparency given how extensively this repo documents and builds on that tree, even
  though Wire-Pod's own source is not copied into this repo's own git history.

## vectorx

- **Author:** Filippo Forchino
- **Upstream:** [github.com/fforchino/vectorx](https://github.com/fforchino/vectorx)
- **Relationship to GOPOD:** GOPOD's Bingo sidecar (`goverlord/runtime/songs/102_brobots_bingo_game/`) began as a
  direct snapshot of this project's own Bingo voice-command code, edited in place since —
  the clearest case of vendored source in this list; the actual `.go` files in this repo
  are derived from vectorx's own. See `goverlord/runtime/songs/102_brobots_bingo_game/README.md` and
  `goverlord/runtime/songs/102_brobots_bingo_game/LICENSE` for the in-place notice.

## vector-go-sdk

- **Repository maintainer:** Filippo Forchino
- **Copyright holder (per the license file itself):** Digital Dream Labs
- **Upstream:** [github.com/fforchino/vector-go-sdk](https://github.com/fforchino/vector-go-sdk)
- **Relationship to GOPOD:** Imported Go module, not vendored source — the Bingo sidecar
  (`goverlord/runtime/songs/102_brobots_bingo_game/pkg/intents/voicecommand_lottery.go`, `cmd/main.go`) imports
  `github.com/fforchino/vector-go-sdk/pkg/sdk-wrapper` and `.../pkg/vectorpb` directly.
  **Note found during this pass, worth flagging plainly:** this module's own `LICENSE`
  file names Digital Dream Labs as the copyright holder, not Filippo Forchino — Forchino
  maintains/hosts this fork of the repository, but the license text itself is unchanged
  from an earlier Digital Dream Labs copyright. Verbatim text below, copied exactly as
  found in the local Go module cache
  (`~/go/pkg/mod/github.com/fforchino/vector-go-sdk@v0.0.0-20231108155304-62168f3595d6/LICENSE`,
  the exact version pinned in `~/wire-pod/chipper/go.mod`).

## wirepod-vector-python-sdk (the `anki_vector` package)

- **Fork maintainer:** kercre123
- **Original copyright holder (per the license file itself):** Anki Inc.
- **Upstream:** [github.com/kercre123/wirepod-vector-python-sdk](https://github.com/kercre123/wirepod-vector-python-sdk)
- **License found on disk — corrects an assumption this task started from:** this package
  is licensed **Apache License, Version 2.0**, not MIT. Confirmed from its own installed
  package metadata (`wirepod_vector_sdk-0.8.1.dist-info/METADATA`: `License: Apache
  License, Version 2.0`) and its own `LICENSE.txt`, which states plainly: "Unless
  otherwise stated in that file, or the folder containing that file, all files in the
  Anki Vector SDK are Copyright (c) 2018 Anki Inc. and licensed under the Apache 2.0
  License." kercre123's fork carries this original Anki notice forward unchanged, exactly
  as Apache-2.0 itself requires (§4(c)).
- **Relationship to GOPOD:** vendored Python fork. GOPOD's Bingo reactor
  (`goverlord/runtime/songs/102_brobots_bingo_game/bingo_reactor/bingo_reactor_001.py`) imports `anki_vector`;
  the installed package is confirmed to be `wirepod_vector_sdk` (kercre123's fork), not
  the original Anki-published package and not a cyb3rdog fork. A local mirror sat at
  `goverlord/SDK/sources/wirepod-vector-python-sdk/` (gitignored, not tracked in this
  repo's own git history); replaced 2026-07-30 with a placeholder note (the original is
  preserved in a private, byte-verified backup outside this repo) — see
  `goverlord/SDK/README.md`.

Unless otherwise stated in that file, or the folder containing that file, all
files in the Anki Vector SDK are Copyright (c) 2018 Anki Inc. and licensed under

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

This file lists licenses for third-party code GOPOD depends on or incorporates. GOPOD's
own original code is MIT licensed — see the root `LICENSE` file. That grant covers the
